This is a toy project to get familiar with the [JSch][1] tool.  There are some
examples probably worth copying, and if you find any use in them, good.  If
not, please look at the [JSch][1] project for more information.  That is where
the wealth of info is at and where I encourage users to go for definitive
examples.
